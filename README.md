# Model Discovery and Tuning

## Project Overview
In this project, I explored and fine-tuned a **Stochastic Gradient Descent Regression (SGD)** model to predict housing prices using the Ames Housing Dataset. The goal was to understand and master the specific model type assigned, including its unique characteristics, use cases, and limitations, and to apply effective hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. The final deliverable provides insights into the model's fit, interpretability, and evaluation metrics.

Key tasks included:
- Documenting the model's purpose, advantages, and limitations.
- Implementing hyperparameter tuning with a focus on impactful parameters.
- Evaluating the model with metrics like R-squared, AIC, and BIC.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data processing and model development
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning model and hyperparameter tuning
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Analysis and documentation

## Repository Structure
- `Data/`: Contains the dataset (`final_model_predictions.csv`) used for model training and evaluation.
- `Code/`: Jupyter Notebook with the model function, tuning process, and evaluation results (`Compagnone_Stefano_A1.ipynb`).
- `Results/`: Model output and predictions, and relevant evaluation metrics.

## Key Insights
- The **SGD model** provided competitive results with R-squared scores on both training and testing data.
- The tuning of hyperparameters significantly impacted the model's performance, especially with parameters like learning rate and penalty term.
- A detailed analysis of AIC, BIC, and train-test gap revealed the model's suitability for this regression task and its limitations.
